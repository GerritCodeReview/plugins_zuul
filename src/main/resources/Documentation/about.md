The @PLUGIN@ plugin detects Zuul [cross repository dependencies]&nbsp;(CRD) in
commit messages and displays them on the Gerrit UI as "Depends on" and "Needed
by" sections in the related changes section.

[Dependency cycles] (although currently only direct dependencies are considered) get highlighted

And dependencies that are not available on the server get highlighted too.

The cross repository dependencies are also exposed through the [REST API](rest-api-changes.html).
